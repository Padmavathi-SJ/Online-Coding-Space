Online Coding Space
Welcome to the Online Coding Space, a dynamic platform where users can enhance their coding skills by solving real-world programming problems. Admins can post various coding challenges, and users are tasked with writing code that passes a set of predefined test cases.

Features:

Admin Dashboard: Admins can create and manage coding problems, including defining test cases that users need to pass.
User Coding Environment: Users can select a problem, write and submit their code in multiple languages, and receive instant feedback on their submissions.
Real-Time Code Execution: Code is executed on the server, and users receive the output of their code along with the results of the test cases.
Progress Tracking: Users can track their progress, see which problems they've completed, and revisit problems they haven't yet solved.
